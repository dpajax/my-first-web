        <b>Automotive design</b>
        The modern automobile is a complex technical system employing subsystems with specific design functions. Some of
        these consist of thousands of component parts that have evolved from breakthroughs in existing technology or
        from new technologies such as electronic computers, high-strength plastics, and new alloys of steel and
        nonferrous metals. Some subsystems have come about as a result of factors such as air pollution, safety
        legislation, and competition between manufacturers throughout the world.



    </p>
    <img src="components-automobile.webp" alt="">

    <p>
        Passenger cars have emerged as the primary means of family transportation, with an estimated 1.4 billion in
        operation worldwide. About one-quarter of these are in the United States, where more than three trillion miles
        (almost five trillion kilometres) are traveled each year. In recent years, Americans have been offered hundreds
        of different models, about half of them from foreign manufacturers. To capitalize on their proprietary
        technological advances, manufacturers introduce new designs ever more frequently. With some 70 million new units
        built each year worldwide, manufacturers have been able to split the market into many very small segments that
        nonetheless remain profitable.
    <p>
        New technical developments are recognized to be the key to successful competition. Research and development
        engineers and scientists have been employed by all automobile manufacturers and suppliers to improve the body,
        chassis, engine, drivetrain, control systems, safety systems, and emission-control systems.

    <p>
        These outstanding technical advancements are not made without economic consequences. According to a study by
        Ward’s Communications Incorporated, the average cost for a new American car increased $4,700 (in terms of the
        value of the dollar in 2000) between 1980 and 2001 because of mandated safety and emission-control performance
        requirements (such as the addition of air bags and catalytic converters). New requirements continued to be
        implemented in subsequent years. The addition of computer technology was another factor driving up car prices,
        which increased by 29 percent between 2009 and 2019. This is in addition to the consumer costs associated with
        engineering improvements in fuel economy, which may be offset by reduced fuel purchases.
    <p>
        Vehicle design depends to a large extent on its intended use. Automobiles for off-road use must be durable,
        simple systems with high resistance to severe overloads and extremes in operating conditions. Conversely,
        products that are intended for high-speed, limited-access road systems require more passenger comfort options,
        increased engine performance, and optimized high-speed handling and vehicle stability. Stability depends
        principally on the distribution of weight between the front and rear wheels, the height of the centre of gravity
        and its position relative to the aerodynamic centre of pressure of the vehicle, suspension characteristics, and
        the selection of which wheels are used for propulsion. Weight distribution depends principally on the location
        and size of the engine. The common practice of front-mounted engines exploits the stability that is more readily
        achieved with this layout. The development of aluminum engines and new manufacturing processes has, however,
        made it possible to locate the engine at the rear without necessarily compromising stability.

                <b> Vehicle Types, Car Body Styles Explained,
                    We break down the hundreds of models for sale today into a tidy group of car body types for easier
                    shopping. </b>

                There's a world of choice in today's car market, what with more than 400 different models and many car
                types available. Making sense of it all can be difficult. What are the different types of cars? The
                first thing to know is that "cars" means "passenger vehicles of all types." For the purposes of keeping
                it simple, we've broken down all of those vehicle choices into nine major categories covering all of the
                basic types of vehicles from coupes to full-size sedans to crossover SUVs.
            <p>

                The easiest way to define a vehicle is by how it looks. What's the first thing you notice when a vehicle
                comes toward you on the street? Its shape. That's called the "body style." Is it tall and boxy? Low and
                sleek? How many doors does it have? Body style is the easiest way to categorize a vehicle.

            <p>
            <h2> <b>SEDAN</b> </h2>

            <img src="2019-honda-civic.jpg" alt="">


            <p>
                A sedan has four doors and a traditional trunk. Like vehicles in many categories, they're available in a
                range of sizes from small (subcompact vehicles like Nissan Versa and Kia Rio) to compacts (Honda Civic,
                Toyota Corolla) to mid-size (Honda Accord, Nissan Altima), and full-size (Toyota Avalon, Dodge Charger).
                Luxury brands like Mercedes-Benz and Lexus have sedans in similar sizes as well.




            <p>
            <h2> <b> COUPE </b> </h2>

            <img src="2019-mercedes-benz-e-class-coupe.jpg" alt="">

            <p> A coupe has historically been considered a two-door car with a trunk and a solid roof. This would
                include cars like a Ford Mustang or Audi A5—or even two-seat sports cars like the Chevrolet Corvette and
                Porsche Boxster. Recently, however, car companies have started to apply the word "coupe" to four-door
                cars or crossovers with low, sleek rooflines that they deem "coupe-like." This includes vehicles as
                disparate as a Mercedes-Benz CLS sedan and BMW X6 SUV. At Car and Driver, we still consider a coupe to
                be a two-door car.

            <p>
            <h2> <b> SPORTS CAR </b> </h2>
            <img src="2019-chevrolet-corvette.jpg" alt="">

            <p> These are the sportiest, hottest, coolest-looking coupes and convertibles—low to the ground, sleek, and
                often expensive. They generally are two-seaters, but sometimes have small rear seats as well. Cars like
                the Porsche 911 and Mazda Miata are typical sports cars, but you can stretch the definition to include
                muscle cars like the Ford Mustang and Dodge Challenger. Then there are the high-end exotic dream cars
                with sky-high price tags for the one percent, cars like the Ferrari 488 GTB and Aston Martin Vantage,
                which stop traffic with their spaceship looks.

            <p>
            <h2> <b> STATION WAGON </b> </h2>
            <img src="2019-volvo-v60.jpg" alt="">

            <p> Wagons are similar to sedans but have an extended roofline and a hatch door at the rear instead of a
                trunk. Some, like the Subaru Outback or Audi A4 Allroad, have elevated ground clearance and some rugged
                body cladding to make them more like a sport-utility vehicle (SUV), but they are nonetheless closely
                related to sedans. Wagons have fallen from favor during the past few decades and there are relatively
                few available for sale in the United States.

            <p>
            <h2> <b> HATCHBACK </b> </h2>
            <img src="2019-HATCHBACK-v60.jpg" alt="">

            <p> Traditionally, the term "hatchback" has meant a compact or subcompact sedan with a squared-off roof and
                a rear flip-up hatch door that provides access to the vehicle's cargo area instead of a conventional
                trunk. The Volkswagen Golf and Kia Rio are two typical hatchbacks. More recently, rear hatches have
                found their way on to some larger cars, like the Audi A7 and Kia Stinger. They look like sedans, but
                they actually have a steeply raked hatchback that affords easier accessibility to the cargo area and
                greater carrying capacity than a traditional trunk would.


            <p>
            <h2> <b> CONVERTIBLE </b> </h2>
            <img src="2019-porche-.jpg" alt="">

            <p> Does the roof retract into the body leaving the passenger cabin open to the elements? If so, it's a
                convertible. Most convertibles have a fully powered fabric roof that folds down, but a few have to be
                lowered by hand. There are also a number of models with a retractable hardtop, as well as several
                unusual quasi-convertibles (called "targa tops") like the Mazda MX-5 Miata RF, Porsche 911 Targa and
                Corvette; only the forward section of their roofs retracts or can be removed by hand.


            <p>
            <h2> <b> SPORT-UTILITY VEHICLE (SUV) </b> </h2>
            <img src="2019-hyundai-kona-.jpg" alt="">

    </p> SUVs—often also referred to as crossovers—tend to be taller and boxier than sedans, offer an elevated seating
    position, and have more ground clearance than a car. They include a station wagon-like cargo area that is accessed
    through a flip-up rear hatch door, and many offer all-wheel drive. The larger ones have three rows of seats. Sizes
    start at subcompact (Hyundai Kona, Nissan Kicks), mid-size, and go all the way to full-size (Ford Expedition,
    Chevrolet Tahoe). Luxury brands offer many SUV models in most of the same size categories.



    <p>
    <h2> <b> MINIVAN </b> </h2>
    <img src="2019-chrysler-pacifica-.jpg" alt="">

    <p> Minivans are the workhorses of the family-car world, the best at carrying people and cargo in an efficient
        package. They're called minivans but they are far from "mini." That's because they are tall boxes-on-wheels with
        sliding side doors for easy access and a rear hatch that opens to a large cargo area. Most minivans have
        adjustable seats in their second and third rows that often can be removed or even folded into the floor to
        create a huge open cargo bay. The Honda Odyssey,Chrysler Pacifica and Toyota Sienna are great examples of the
        breed.


    </p>
    <h2> <b> PICKUP TRUCK </b> </h2>
    <img src="2019-honda-ridgeline-.jpg" alt="">

    </p> A pickup truck has a passenger cab and an open cargo bed in the rear. Virtually all pickups offer some form of
    all-wheel drive or part-time four-wheel drive—the latter for off-road use only. With one exception—the mid-sized
    Honda Ridgeline—pickup bodies are cabs mounted to a separate steel frame. The Ridgeline is more like a crossover
    with the rear section of the roof lopped off to expose a cargo bed. Currently, pickup trucks come in two size
    categories: full-size and mid-size.



    <p>
    <h3> <b> IT DOESN'T STOP THERE </b> </h3>
    <img src="2019-bmw-x4-jpg.jpeg" alt="">

    <p> There's more to it than basic body types. Those 10 types of vehicles are available from dozens of different
        brands from Acura to Volvo—and in many sizes and at widely varying prices. But there are always a few outliers
        that don't quite fit neatly into any category, like the BMW X4 "four-door coupe SUV" pictured above.
